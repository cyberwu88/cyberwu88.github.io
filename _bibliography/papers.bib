abstract = {As IoT devices become more incorporated into our daily lives, their always on approach makes them an ideal source of evidence. While these devices should use encryption to protect sensitive information, in reality this is not always the case e.g. some expose sensitive data like credentials in cleartext. In this paper, we have conducted an extensive analysis on the communications channels of 32 IoT consumer devices. Our experiments consisted of four main parts; first we carried out a port scan to determine if any ports can be exploited and thus gain remote access. Second, we looked at whether any of the devices used encryption and if not what type of content was exposed. Third, we used the network traffic ‘metadata’ to identify the destination the data terminated. Finally, we examined the communication between the mobile app and the cloud to see if it can be easily exploited using a proxy server. Our findings show that the majority of devices have remote access unavailable. We found the Shannon entropy test a useful pre-test in identifying unencrypted content. Although many devices encrypted their data, we found several in particular smart cameras would send data in cleartext when they detected motion or during updates. We found the majority of data transverses to the US and stored on Amazon servers with most devices contacting multiple destination. Lastly, we discovered many of the IoT device's mobile apps can be easily exploited using a HTTP Proxy.}

abstract = {Publications in the digital forensics domain frequently come with tools – a small piece of functional software. These tools are often released to the public for others to reproduce results or use them for their own purposes. However, there has been no study on the tools to understand better what is available and what is missing. For this paper we analyzed almost 800 articles from pertinent venues from 2014 to 2019 to answer the following three questions (1) what tools (i.e., in which domains of digital forensics): have been released; (2) are they still available, maintained, and documented; and (3) are there possibilities to enhance the status quo? We found 62 different tools which we categorized according to digital forensics subfields. Only 33 of these tools were found to be publicly available, the majority of these were not maintained after development. In order to enhance the status quo, one recommendation is a centralized repository specifically for tested tools. This will require tool researchers (developers) to spend more time on code documentation and preferably develop plugins instead of stand-alone tools.}

abstract = {Interactions with IoT devices generates vast amounts of personal data that can be used as a source of evidence in digital investigations. Currently, there are many challenges in IoT forensics such as the difficulty in acquiring and analysing IoT data/devices and the lack IoT forensic tools. Besides technical challenges, there are many concepts in IoT forensics that have yet to be explored such as definitions, experience and capability in the analysis of IoT data/devices and current/future challenges. A deeper understanding of these various concepts will help progress the field. To achieve this goal, we conducted a survey which received 70 responses and provided the following results: (1) IoT forensics is a sub-domain of digital forensics, but it is undecided what domains are included; (2) practitioners are already having to examine IoT devices even though they felt undertrained; (3) requirements for technical training, software and education are non-existent; (4) high priority on research should be to develop IoT forensic tools, how to preserve volatile data and methods to identify and acquire data from the cloud; (5) improvements to forensic tools should be aimed at data acquisition (imaging) and device disassembly / forensic process; (6) practitioners' perspectives on research direction differ slightly to non-practitioners in that the focus should be on breaking encryption on IoT devices rather than focus on cloud data forensics; (7) future research should focus on developing initiatives and strategies to overcome data encryption and trail obfuscation in the cloud and ongoing development of IoT forensic tools. The responses to the survey question on the definition of IoT forensics helped us formulate a working definition. This has provided a clearer understanding of the subject, which will help further advance the research area.},

abstract = {With the increasing threat of sophisticated attacks on critical infrastructures, it is vital that forensic investigations take place immediately following a security incident. This paper presents an existing SCADA forensic process model and proposes a structured SCADA forensic process model to carry out a forensic investigations. A discussion on the limitations of using traditional forensic investigative processes and the challenges facing forensic investigators. Furthermore, flaws of existing research into providing forensic capability for SCADA systems are examined in detail. The study concludes with an experimentation of a proposed SCADA forensic capability architecture on the Siemens S7 PLC. Modifications to the memory addresses are monitored and recorded for forensic evidence. The collected forensic evidence will be used to aid the reconstruction of a timeline of events, in addition to other collected forensic evidence such as network packet captures.},
