Scenario 1- Man in the middle attack Scenario

Off-the-shelf serial to IP converters such as Moxa and Perle are used to send serial data over IP/ethernet networks.

GPS data is captured in the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) 0183 format which is in plaintext so they can be easily intercepted and modified.

The messages can be modified using a man in the middle attack called ARP poisoning. This involves sending falsified ARP packets to the router in order to link the attack machine’s MAC address with the IP address of the legitimate device on the network.  

Once the attacker’s MAC address is linked to the authentic IP address the attack machine  they will receive any messages directed to the legitimate MAC address. 

The serial traffic is then routed through the attack machine where several parameters in the NMEA 0183 messages can be modified. Making minor modifications can slowly force the ship to change course as data is eventually fed to the ECDIS console.
